user is fetched from the dedicated data servers and sent to the computer now all this takes time and to keep the user busy they decided to give them a puzzle to solve if the user solves the puzzle correctly they are allowed to login the puzzle is as follows a string s composed of only small case letters of the english alphabet is shown on the screen to the user then two integers p and q are

his love for racing sports he is an avid formula fan he went to watch this year s indian grand prix at new delhi he noticed that one segment of the circuit was a long straight road it was impossible for a car to overtake other cars on this segment therefore a car had to lower down its speed if there was a slower car in front of it while watching the race chef started to wonder how many cars were moving at their maximum speed formally you re given the maximum speed of n cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit each car prefers to move at its maximum speed if that s not possible because of the front car being slow it might have to lower its speed it still moves at the fastest possible speed while avoiding any collisions for the purpose of this problem you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long count the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment input\nthe first line of the input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases to follow description of each test case contains lines the first of these lines contain a single integer n the number of cars the second line contains n

were moving at their maximum speed on the segment constraints t n all speeds are distinct positive integers that fit in a bit signed integer each input file will not be larger than mb bytes in size warning the input files are very large use faster i o sample input sample output explanation\ntest case there is only car thus it can move at its maximum speed test case the first car moves at speed the second car can move at speed without colliding with the first car for the third car if it moves at speed it would collide with the second car after some finite amount of time the maximum speed at which the third car can move avoiding any collision is thus cars can move at their maximum speed test case following are the maximum speeds of all the cars the first car moves at a maximum speed of the maximum speed at which the second car can move without colliding is the third car can move at its maximum speed which is the maximum speed at which the fourth car can move without colliding is the

is movie a with ticket price rs the total profit is since each movie was watched by at least one person there is no additional loss example case just like above we show the requests in a table a b c d the optimal solution is to play movie a at pm movie b at pm movie c at pm and movie d at pm with decreasing ticket prices in this order the profit is example case again we show the requests in a table a b c d the optimal solution is to play movie a at pm with ticket price rs movie b at pm with ticket price rs and the remaining two movies in any order at pm and pm either way there will be nobody watching them we earn but we have to deduct rs so the resulting profit is example case the optimal solution is to play movie d at pm the other three movies go unattended we have to deduct rs so the

more stress however like it or not ron still need to try his best not to let this course ruins his great gpa can you help him with his first assignment which is described below in this assignment ron is given an n n pixels image called sample image ron is required to create a copy of the sample image using an simple graphic painting program called smpaint only two types of operation can be used in smpaint init make the new image with the specific size all the pixels of the new image are white paint user gives integers c u d l r and smpaint will change colour to c at all the pixels x y such that u x d and l y r the pixel x y is the pixel at the xth row from the top indexed and the yth column from the left side indexed we can see that the paint operation actually is painting a specific rectangle in the image by one specific colour the image in the figure can be drawn using calls of the second function if we paint the red rectangle first and then paint two green rectangles notice that if a pixel is changed colour several time it final colour is corresponding to the last time it is painted this help us save some calls of the second function for the image in figure we can paint a large green rectangle first and then paint the red rectangle your mission is help ron finish the assignment with using as least as possible number of calls of the second function input\nthe first

and vietnamese as well there is a cluster of computers each computer is referred as a node you are the maintainer of the cluster your job is to execute various jobs that you receive for execution you can transfer a job from a node on the cluster to some other node it will require some network cost the jobs come in the batches each job will have its desired initial node on which it was thought to be run by its programmer it will also require some processing power to run in a node you have to process the jobs of the batch i e you have to decide on which node the job should be executed you can transfer the job through various nodes before assigning the final node being the cluster maintainer your aim is to optimally use the resources of the cluster you want the load on the nodes of the cluster to be balanced also you don t want to spend a huge networking cost in transferring the jobs in between the nodes input\nthe problem is an interactive challenge problem first line of the input will contain four space separated integers n m b c denoting number of nodes in the cluster the total number of batches of the jobs batch size i e number of jobs per batch and maximum network cost that you can afford respectively each of the next n lines contains n space separated integers denoting the network cost required for moving the job among corresponding nodes each of the next m lines contains b integers denoting the nodes on which the job was scheduled to run and the processing power it will require output\nafter reading a batch you should output b integers each showing the corresponding node on which the job is assigned note that network cost spent in moving this job from a node to other node will be equal to shortest network cost required example\ninput\toutput explanation in our example number of nodes number of batches and number of jobs per batch and networking cost all are equal to cost of moving a job from node to node is in the first batch there are two jobs first job is intended to run at node it will require a processing power of the second job is intended to run on node requiring a processing power of units you have decided to run job at node and job at node i e at the nodes where they were initially supposed to run so no network cost has been incurred for it in the second batch there are two jobs also first job is intended to run at node it will require a processing power of units the second job is intended to run on node requiring a processing power of units you have decided to run job at node and job at node for first job you are moving the job from the node to node for which you have to spend a network cost of units similarly job also requires a networking cost of units total network cost incurred in this solution is units which was the maximum network cost allowed scoring\nafter assigning all the jobs of a batch load unbalancing factor of the cluster will be measured let load on a node be total sum of processing powers of the jobs assigned on this cluster please note that his accounts for all the jobs assigned to this node not just the jobs assigned in the current batch in particular it will also include all older batches of jobs too load unbalancing factor of the cluster will be equal to maximum load on some node minus the minimum load on some node total unbalancing factor will be sum of load unbalancing factor over all the batch jobs let us calculate the load unbalancing factor in the above example let us consider the first batch of jobs at node we are running a job requiring processing power of units and that at node of units so load unbalancing factor is after assigning the jobs of the second batch we have two jobs at node each of units i e total units of processing power required at the second node we have two jobs running one requiring a processing power of and other of total units so load unbalancing factor is overall total sum of load unbalancing factors for these two batches will be so your score will be test generation process there will be two types of data sets small and large test files for each during the contest the score will be shown for only of the test cases i e

score shown will only be for the of data i e files your final score on all the files will be shown after the end of the contest only here is the test generation process for small and large data sets of the problem values of n m b each will be fixed to for small data set and for large data set maximum network cost c will be generated uniformly randomly from m b to m b the network cost required for moving a job from a node to other node will be generated uniformly randomly from to note that you are guaranteed that cost function will be symmetric i e the cost of moving a job from node x to node y will be same as that of moving job from node y to node x also the cost of moving a job from a node to the same node will be zero for each job in a batch the node on which job is to be scheduled will be generated uniformly randomly from to n processing power of the job will also be generated uniformly randomly from to here are some possible things you should keep in mind for making sure your submission does not get an wa wrong answer verdict you have to process each batch of jobs before reading the next batch please don t forget to flush the standard output before reading the next batch you can flush standard output by using fflush stdout in c c total network cost for moving the jobs from one node should not maximum network cost c finally your aim is to minimize the total load

then rests for r minutes then works some more and so on by the way chef has m books he wants to read each book has some given number of pages and chef reads one page per minute independent of which page of whichever book it is chef has two types of books to read the first type are too interesting for an interrupted read and therefore need to be finished in one continuous reading session that is some ith resting period or a part of it books of the second type are more casual reads which can be split up in any way between different resting periods read a few pages then read another book or do the job and continue later chef is getting tired when switch that is why each book can be read for some times only once per rest let us take an example if chef has a rest period array r and books types to read st min nd min chef can finish the first book in the first rest period minutes from st to rd and use the th minute of first period along with the second and third periods to finish the second book some books are part of a series and need to be read in order in other words some books can t be started until some other books are done you are given this information in the form of

discussing approaches to the problem or what type or speed of algorithm is required problem statement chef doom has decided to bake a circular cake he wants to place n colored cherries around the cake in a circular manner as all great chefs do doom doesn t want any two adjacent cherries to have the same color chef has unlimited supply of cherries of k different colors each color is denoted by the digit from the set k different colors are denoted by different digits some of the cherries are already placed and the chef wants you to place cherries in the remaining positions he understands that there can be many such arrangements so in the case when the answer is not unique he asks you to find the lexicographically smallest one what does it mean let s numerate positions for the cherries by the numbers n starting from one of the positions in a clockwise direction then the current possibly partial arrangement of the cherries can be represented by a string of n characters for each position i of the arrangement if the cherry of the color c is placed at this position then the ith character of the string is equal to the digit c otherwise it is equal to the question mark we identify the arrangement with the string that represents it one arrangement is called lexicographically smaller than the other arrangement if at the first position where they differ the first one has smaller digit we compare only complete arrangements so we don t care about relation between digits and the question mark for example the arrangement is lexicographically smaller than since they have first equal characters but the th character in the first arrangement is and it is less than which is the th character of the second arrangement notes the cherries at the first and the last positions are adjacent to each other recall that we have a circular cake in the case n any arrangement is valid as long as the color used for the only cherry of this arrangement is less than k initial arrangement can be already invalid see the case in the example just to make all things clear you will be given a usual string of digits and question marks don t be confused by circular stuff we have in this problem you don t have to rotate the answer once you have replaced all question marks by the digits think of the output like the usual string for which each two consecutive digits must be different but having additional condition that the first and the last digits must be also different of course if n next you don t have to use all colors the only important condition is that this string should be lexicographically smaller than all other strings that can be obtained from the input string by replacement of question marks by digits and of course it must satisfy conditions on adjacent digits one more thing k here is not the length of the string but the number of allowed colors also we emphasize that the given string can have arbitrary number of question marks so it can have zero number of question marks as well as completely consists of question marks but of course in general situation it can have both digits and question marks ok let s try to formalize things in order to make all even more clear you will be given an integer k and a string s s s s n where each s i is either the decimal digit less than k or the question mark we are serious in all tests string s can have only digits less than k don t ask about what to do if we have digit k there are no such tests at all we guarantee this ok let s continue your task is to replace each question mark by some digit strictly less than k if there were no question marks in the string skip this step now if n then your string is already valid for n it must satisfy the following n conditions s s s s s n s n s n s among all such valid strings that can be obtained by replacement of question marks you should choose lexicographically smallest one i hope now the problem is really clear input the first line of the input file contains an integer t the number of test cases t test cases follow each test case consists of exactly two lines the first line contains an integer k the number of available colors for cherries the second line contains a string s that represents the current arrangement of the cherries in the cake constraints t k s where s denotes the length of the string s\neach character in s is either the digit from the set k or the question mark output for each test case output the lexicographically smallest valid arrangement of the cherries in the cake that can be obtained from the given arrangement by replacement of each question mark by some digit from to k if it is impossible to place the cherries output no output is case sensitive sample input sample output no explanation case the only possible replacement here is note that we output since we can not rotate the answer to obtain which is smaller case arrangement is impossible because cherries at the first and the last positions are already of the same color note that k but the string has length it is normal k and s don t have any connection case there are two possible arrangements and the answer is the first one since it is lexicographically

valued possession is a huge collection of poison which is stored in the central kxk grid it is guaranteed that both n and k are odd what we mean by central is this suppose in the nxn grid i j refers to the cell in the i th row and j th column and refers to the top left corner and n n refers to the bottom right corner then the poison is stored in the kxk square whose top left corner is n k n k but there are thieves who want to steal the poison they cannot enter the nxn grid but they can shoot arrows from outside these arrows travel across a row from left to right or right to left or across a column top to bottom or bottom to top in a straight line if the arrow enters the kxk grid some of the poison will stick to the arrow and if it exits the nxn grid after that the thieves will have successfully stolen some of the poison as the king of the snakes you want to thwart these attempts you know that the arrows will break and stop if they hit a snake s scaly skin but won t hurt the snakes there are some snakes already guarding the poison each snake occupies some consecutive cells in a straight line inside the nxn grid that is they are either part of a row or part of a column note that there can be intersections between the snakes a configuration of snakes is safe if the thieves cannot steal poison that is no matter which row or column they shoot arrows from either the arrow should hit a snake and stop this can happen even after it has entered and exited the kxk grid or it shouldn t ever enter the kxk grid the king has other duties for the snakes and hence wants to remove as many snakes as possible from this configuration such that the remaining configuration is still safe help him find the minimum number of snakes he needs to leave behind to protect the poison input the first line contains a single integer t the number of testcases the first line of each testcase contains three integers n k and m where n is the size of the entire square grid k is the size

th snake txi tyi is the cell which contains the tail of the i th snake it is guaranteed that both these cells will either lie in the same row or same column and hence the cells in between them including these two cells represents the i th snake output for each testcase output a single integer in a new line the minimum number of the snakes that the king can keep and still protect the poison if it is not possible to protect the poison even with all the snakes output constraints t n k n both n and k will be odd integers m hxi hyi txi tyi n\nit is guaranteed that at least one of hxi txi and hyi tyi will be true for all i\nnone of the cells in the kxk grid will be occupied by any snake example\ninput output explanation\nthe first example corresponds to note that the top left corner cell of the nxn grid is by definition the inner square contains the poison and the seven snakes are shown in different colours the green snake is the st snake in the input we can remove all but snakes and protect the poison one such configuration is this you can check that no arrow can enter the inner poison square and exit the outer square without hitting a snake hence is it safe also you cannot do this with fewer snakes hence is the answer the second testcase corresponds to you can check that even with all the snakes this is not a safe configuration because the thieves can shoot an arrow down

of danavas they were known to be really strong and they did not have any war strategy they would just attack the enemy randomly and overpower them with sheer number of soldiers however we all know that baahubali and bhallaladeva defeated the kalakeyas by following the thrishul strategy and successfully defended their kingdom maahishmati we also know that baahubali was very smart and the truth is that he predicted how the kalakeyas would attack and devised a counter strategy for the same the night before the war this is what he found the kalakeyas had n forts numbered to n and baahubali had n soldiers numbered to n baahubali discovered that he can permute his soldiers in any way to get a permutation of to n p p pn he would then send his soldiers to attack the forts in the following way soldier p attacks fort soldier p attacks fort soldier pn attacks fort n it is easy to note that each soldier attacks exactly one fort and no two soldiers attack the same fort baahubali also got to know about a secret key of the kalakeyas which is an integer k a soldier x can destroy a fort y iff abs x y k for more details on the abs function check here your task is to determine whether baahubali s soldiers can be permuted in some way such that all forts can be destroyed in other words for a permutation p p pn baahubali s soldiers can destroy all the forts iff abs pi i k for all i n

it is impossible to permute in any way such that abs p and abs p hence output is for the second test case n and k we can just set p i i and hence the answer is for the third case the valid

guests invented by lift boy was used but after realizing all badness of this scheme chef fired lift boy and simplifies the process of allocating guests drastically now at the time of check in each guest only provides the preferable room for him and the number of minutes he will stay in the hotel after that the hotel manager finds the first available room starting from the provided one assuming that rooms in the hotel are arranged in cyclic manner namely let there be r rooms in the hotel and they are numbered by numbers from to r inclusive suppose guest chooses the room k then the hotel manager checks rooms in orderk k k r r k k and allocates the guest in the first free room in this list or report the guest that all rooms are occupied if this is the case chef has a logbook where hotel manager writes down information about each guest namely he records the visit time the preferable room for the guest not the actual room where guest will live the staying time and the inconvenience caused to the guest which equals to the number of occupied rooms that hotel manager checks in the list above before allocating the guest or r if all rooms are occupied the visit time is provided in minutes after the moment when hotel was opened for visits before the first visit all rooms in the hotel were free when guest leaves the room it could be occupied at the same moment of time by another guest if exactly at this moment the visit occurs but lift boy prepared the revenge to the chef just before the inspection of the hotel he has erased the second and the third entry of each visit in the logbook that is the preferable room and staying time for each guest chef needs to recover the damage quickly since only a few hours left before inspector visit he knows about your advanced skills in programming and asks you for help he will be satisfied by any consistent recover of the data that is if inspector will reproduce the process of allocating guests using the visit time the preferable room and the staying time for each guest he will obtain the correct value of the inconvenience caused to each guest input\nthe first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases the description of t test cases follows the first line of each test case contains two space separated integers r and n denoting the number of rooms and the number of visits respectively the description of n damaged records in logbook follows namely each of the following n lines contains space separated integers time and inconv denoting the time of the visit and inconvenience caused to the guest output\nfor each test case output n lines the i th line among them should contain two space separated integers room and stay time the room chosen by the i th guest and the time he will stay in the hotel room should be from to r inclusive and stay time should be from to inclusive if there are several possible answers you can output any of them but your output should be consistent as stated above existence of such answer is always guaranteed for our test data see constraints section below constraints t r n time inconv r\nthe sum of r over the input does not exceed the sum of n over the input does not exceed visit times will be given in strictly increasing order\nit is guaranteed that records in logbook could be recovered consistently note that time is strictly less than it is quite important example\ninput output explanation\nexample case here r and n let s check that provided output is consistent the first guest comes at time and asks for room for minutes since the hotel is initially empty we settle him at this room causing zero inconvenience the second guest comes at time and asks for room for minutes the first guest made this room free at time so at time it is free and we settle the second guest at room causing zero inconvenience example case here r and n again let s check that provided output is consistent the first guest comes at time and asks for room for minutes since the hotel is initially empty we settle him at this room causing zero inconvenience the second guest comes at time and asks for room for minutes but the first guest is still living in this room he will free it at time therefore we settle the second guest at the room the next after in cyclic manner causing inconvenience finally the third guest comes at time and asks for room for minutes this room is free and we settle him at this room causing zero inconvenience example case here r and n and again let s check that provided output is consistent the first guest comes at time and asks for room for minutes since the hotel is initially empty we settle him at this room causing zero inconvenience the second guest comes at time and asks for room for minutes this room is free and we settle him at this room causing zero inconvenience the third guest comes at time and asks for room for minutes but both rooms in the hotel are occupied room will be free at time and room will be free at time hence we do not settle this guest in any room causing him inconvenience note that stay time of such a guest actually doesn t matter you could output any number from

well as every other little boy mike has a favorite toy to play with mike s favorite toy is a set of n disks the boy likes to compose his disks in stacks but there s one very important rule the disks in a single stack must be ordered by their radiuses in a strictly increasing order such that the top most disk will have the smallest radius for example a stack of disks with radii is valid while a stack of disks with radii is not little mike has recently come up with the following algorithm after the order of disks are given first mike initiates an empty set of disk stacks then mike processes the disks in the chosen order using the following pattern if there is at least one stack such that mike can put the current disk on the top of the stack without making it invalid then he chooses the stack with the smallest top disk radius strictly greater than the radius of the current disk and puts the current disk on top of that stack otherwise mike makes a new stack containing only the current disk for example let s assume that the order of the disk radii is here s how the set of the top stack disks will appear during the algorithm s run in the beginning of the algorithm the set of disk stacks is empty after processing the first disk the set of top stack disks is we cannot put the second disk on the only stack that we have after processing the first disk so we make a new stack after processing the second disk the set of top stack disks is we cannot put the third disk on any of the available stacks so we make a new stack after processing the third disk the set of top stack disks is the fourth disk has radius so it can be easily put on any of the available stacks according to the algorithm we choose the stack with the top disk radius equal to after processing the fourth disk the set of top stack disks is the fifth disk has radius so there are two stacks we can put it on according to the algorithm we choose the stack with the top disk radius equal to after processing the fifth disk the set of top stack disks is the sixth disk has radius so there is only one stack we can put it on the final set of top stack disks is mike is really excited about his new algorithm but he

providing an array aa and an integer xx to it and checking if the returned index is correct however the teacher is lazy and provides the exact same array to all codes the only thing that varies is the

with him little bears love playing games the drawing shows a building with a roof on the top the building is represented by a square and the roof by an isosceles triangle in the coordinate system formally the following conditions are guaranteed both the square and the triangle are non degenerate i e their areas are positive and not zero the bottom side of the triangle is its base the bottom side of the square lies on the x axis while the top side is a part of the base of the triangle the base of the triangle is longer that the side of the square the whole drawing is symmetric with respect to the y axis all vertices of the square and the triangle have integer coordinates and their absolute values do not exceed all y coordinates are non negative an example of a valid drawing your task is to find the total area of the house the sum of areas of the square and the triangle to achieve that you are allowed to ask at most queries in each query you choose some point with integer coordinates and the system will tell you if this point is in the house including its boundary interaction\nat most times you can ask a query by printing x y without the quotes in a singe line coordinates x and y should be integers such that x and y after flushing the output you should read a response that is a string yes or no without the quotes in a single line a response yes means that the point x y is inside the house or on its boundary while no means that it s outside finally you should print the answer in the form s without the quotes where s is an integer denoting the area of the house it can be proved that it must be integer then terminate your program notes for each test the house is fixed and it doesn t change during queries it s even allowed to guess the area and print the answer as s without asking any queries but obviously asking queries first might be useful after submitting your program you will see which tests it passes the first test there task matches the example test and drawings from this statement asking more than queries or printing invalid coordinates not from allowed range results in the verdict wa wrong answer printing the answer doesn t count as asking a query in particular you can ask exactly queries and print the answer after that you can t ask more queries after printing the answer you can ask the same query more than once subtasks subtask points the absolute values of the coordinates of vertices don t exceed subtask points original constraints absolute values of coordinates can be up to example\nyou system yes yes no yes yes no no yes explanation\nthe example test matches the drawing from the statement the square has side while the triangle has base and height the answer is above you can see an example of communication with the system for example the first query asks about the point it is on the boundary so the response is yes on the drawing below blue and red points denote queries with response yes and no respectively

your support opposition more your influence usually it is hard to determine whether a person supports opposes the moves just by reading their posts as they will make some oblique references here and there often followed by a big digression into cat dog memes and name calling as the final resort sometimes as a first resort too in rare cases but you came to know from fb ai team that the people whose support this move behave slightly oddly specifically fb team told that a person will be a supporter if number of divisors of the number of posts a person makes is an odd prime number you are given information about number of posts each person makes specifically person i makes pi posts a study about user behavior tells that no one likes to have same number of posts as the other persons as

the minimum of capacities of pipes in this path the amount of water that can be sent from to n m n m per unit of time is the maximum of these minimum values or if there is no valid path help faruk

he spends for waiting for a bus is as small as possible besides he must be at the bus station n before or at the time t for a specially important meeting note that he may wait for a meeting if he

beings and as before they keep this data in their secured data center with the help of these data along with the advanced technologies aliens had initiated a project called it s the end to get rid of the human beings and occupy the earth stupid humans how could they allow this again chef po has thought and started connecting to the aliens data center to save the earth again the first thing he noticed is that there are n servers in the aliens data center and they are arranged in a line aliens have rearranged the data center to avoid grid hacking mechanism refer to this but this is not needed to understand this problem denote the i th server as server i i n aliens had divided the data file with the data about the birth of the human beings into n parts denoted as f i i n and placed the part f i at the server i each server has a password a non negative integer chef po needs to crack all the servers in order to get all parts of the data file the aliens are really strange beings so they single out two types of passwords power password a number of the form ab a b the list of power passwords starts with non power password any other number this list starts with for simplicity we shall call server secured by a power password as power server and the server secured by a non power password as non power server all non power servers have a friendly screen with the color indicator suppose you enter a password trying to guess the actual password of such a server the indicator will then become green if you enter a number which is smaller than the actual password it will become red if your number is greater than the actual password or you will get the access to the server and thus to the needed part of the data file if the password is correct on the other hand each power server has no such screen and the only way to crack it is to try all power passwords until you find out the correct password so our chef simply iterate over the list of power passwords in increasing order and try them until he finds the correct password after the last adventure with aliens chef became smarter so he will use binary search to crack non power servers namely let a a a a be the sequence of all non power passwords at first he will try passwords a a a a until he either reaches the correct one or the indicator becomes red for the first time if indicator becomes red at the password a then he enters a at the next step and cracks the server since is the only non power password less than let the indicator becomes red at the password a k where k while for the password a k indicator was green then chef sets l k r k and uses usual binary search to crack the server after that namely at each step he sets m l r div and checks the password a m if it is correct he finishes the process if indicator becomes green he sets l m and continue the process finally if indicator becomes red he sets r m and continue the process let s consider some examples suppose the password is it s a power password so chef will not see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is a power server hence he will try the password then and then making tries in all suppose the password is it s a non power password so chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is a non power server hence he will try the passwords a a in order making tries in all suppose the password is it s a non power password hence he will try the passwords a a a a a in order making tries in all suppose the password is it s a non power password he will crack this server from the first try since a you are the secret aliens agent that got to know about chef s plan your first goal is to estimate the time chef will spend on cracking each server so that aliens

he just needs to pick qq valid reparentings he makes an initial list ll of all valid reparentings for this tree and sorts them in a special order let r u v r u v and r u v r u v be valid reparentings their order is decided as follows if u u u u then r r r r if u u u u then r r r r if u u u u find the distances of nodes vv and v v from the root and denote them by hh and h h respectively\nif u u u u

as follows tomya chooses a color and tomya bets some coins suppose x coins are bet on the color here x must be non negative integer at most l and tomya must have x coins before betting then ciel chooses a ball from the box checks its color and discards the ball if the ball has the same color as tomya s bet then tomya gets b x coins otherwise tomya must pay x coins note that if tomya wins then she receives back her bet as well as b x coins while the box has at least one ball the above process are repeated when the box is empty the game is over the game is very kind because tomya always can increase her coins instead of this ciel is not kind in this game she chooses the balls which minimize tomya s coins at the end of the game yes she can choose balls as she likes your task is to

etc some raid use complete duplication some use parity and so on in this problem we consider our own way to store redundant data of hard disks you are provided with n hard disk and n files each

disks state as in last hour which have id greater than or equal to it i e from i to n after this copying some files might occur multiple times in this hard disk it deletes all the files which occur

in meditation at a particular place on swarglok the heaven considering swarglok as a dimensional plane the position of each devta is a fixed point with integer coordinates the positions of all the devtas are distinct from each other while meditating the devtas connect to each other by means of astral projections metaphysical threads that connect one devta to another they must do so in such a way to satisfy two criteria each devta must be able to connect to every other devta by following a path of astral projections no subgroup of devtas may be connected by a cycle of astral projections in simple terms the astral projections must form a tree connecting all devtas what needs to be optimized once the devtas have taken their positions and are connected as a single group to start meditation a ring of influence is formed around each devta this ring is centered at the position of the devta and has a radius equal to the euclidean distance from this devta to the furthest devta directly connected via an astral projection since different devtas have their own supernatural powers indra is the rain god agni is the fire god varuna is the water god vayu is the air god etc the influence ring of each devta has an adverse effect on all other devtas which lie within or on this ring in other words the efficiency of a devta to perform meditation decreases as the number of influence rings

can never be a chapter sequence in tarantino s movies he can have a sequence of chapter chapter chapter instead recently santa gifted tom a movie which consists of n chapters this movie can possibly be directed by your favorite tarantino or by someone else directors in hollywood can sometimes be very sloppy they sometimes drop some chapters too and stupid they are that they will leave numbering of the chapters as it is and one can easily identify the chapters that were dropped for example if you find the sequence of chapters as chapter chapter chapter don t be surprised they did not even take burden of renumbering the chapters to chapter chapter chapter they can sometimes repeat the chapter numbers too remember that tarantino is not a sloppy director so he never makes this kind of

cc encodes a block of s while cc encodes a block of s perform the swapping operation in any way as many times as you want including zero times so that the final string ss has as many subsequences as

odd what we mean by central is this suppose in the nxn grid i j refers to the cell in the i th row and j th column and refers to the top left corner and n n refers to the bottom right corner then the poison is stored in the kxk square whose top left corner is n k n k but there are thieves who want to steal the poison they cannot enter the nxn grid but they can shoot arrows from outside these arrows travel across a row from left to right or right to left or across a column top to bottom or bottom to top in a straight line if the arrow enters the kxk grid some of the poison will stick to the arrow and if it exits the nxn grid after that the thieves will have successfully stolen some of the poison as the king of the snakes you want to thwart these attempts you know that the arrows will break and stop if they hit a snake s scaly skin but won t hurt the snakes there are some snakes already guarding the poison each snake occupies some consecutive cells in a straight line inside the nxn grid that is they are either part of a row or part of a column note that there can be intersections between the snakes a configuration of snakes is safe if the thieves cannot steal poison that is no matter which row or column they shoot arrows from either the arrow should hit a snake and stop this can happen even after it has entered and exited the kxk grid or it shouldn t ever enter the kxk grid

first example corresponds to note that the top left corner cell of the nxn grid is by definition the inner square contains the poison and the seven snakes are shown in different colours the green snake is the st snake in the input we can remove all but snakes and protect the poison one such configuration is this you can check that no arrow can enter the inner poison square and exit the outer square without hitting a snake hence is it safe also you cannot do this with fewer snakes hence is the answer the second testcase corresponds to you can check that even with all the snakes this is not

many sorting techniques such as insertion sort bubble sort selection sort quick sort merge sort heap sort etc here i will talk about a different type of sorting technique which is called as radix sort

significant digit to the most significant digit a sort input array using counting sort or any stable sort according to the i th digit example\noriginal unsorted list sorting by least significant digit s place gives notice that we keep before because occurred before in the original list and similarly for pairs and sorting by next digit s place gives notice that again comes before as comes before in the previous list sorting by most significant digit s place gives hence we get a sorted sequence for the corresponding random sequence for a given set of n random numbers generate a sorted non

has nn number cars there are mm number of machines which produce cars of its corresponding type for example a type machine would produce type car only there is only one machine for each type each machine has a special button that reverses the logic of the circuit used in the toy car for example if the logic circuit of the car is designed to move forward when turned on then by pressing this special button on this machine the car produced would move backward instead of moving forward similarly if the logic circuit of the car is designed to move backward when turned on then by pressing this special button on this machine the car produced would move forward instead of moving backward thus revering the logic kk is the number of machines in which this special button is turned on a car is said to have correct logic if and only if it moves forward when turned on a car is said to have incorrect logic if it moves backward when turned on the factory has produced mm nn number of toy cars

numbered from to n king cobra has decided that he wants to eliminate the mongooses and is hence preparing to wage a war the snakes have recently procured airplanes and thus they can parachute their soldiers onto some of the mongoose land cities suppose on day these soldiers are parachuted you know that to capture city i you need to parachute in pi soldiers by end of day they would have captured their respective cities each city depends on its neighbors for some of its supplies and so if a certain number of its neighbors are captured then this city will fall as well in particular for every city i you know that if city i was uncaptured on day d and at least ci of its neighbors are captured on day d then this city will be captured on day d where d a city which has been captured will forever remain captured king cobra doesn t mind waiting for however long it takes to capture the entire mongoose kingdom but he wants to do it with the least number of soldiers help him find the least number of soldiers he should send so that the entire mongoose kingdom can be captured eventually formally you need to find a subset of cities s such that the sum of pi over these cities is minimized and the entire kingdom will be captured eventually if soldiers are parachuted into exactly these cities you need to output this minimum sum input the first line contains a single integer t denoting the number of testcases the description of each testcase follows the first line of each testcase contains a single integer n the number of cities in mongoose land the i th of the next n lines contain

capture city i on day the next line contains n integers c c cn ci denotes the number of neighbors of city i that have to be captured for city i to be captured on the next day output for each testcase output a single integer which is the minimum total number of soldiers who have to be parachuted in on day constraints t n ui vi n pi ci degree of city i example\ninput output explanation\none of the optimal solutions is to parachute into cities and on day so the total number of soldiers needed p p p now we will show that this is indeed a valid solution for that we need to show that eventually all the cities will be captured we will show the cities captured on every day in sequence day the cities captured are the ones parachuted into and they are day city has one of its neighbors city captured and since c this is enough for city to be captured similarly since c and city is a neighbor of city city is also captured so cities captured on day day city has c and one of its neighbors is captured city hence it is captured now city has c and three of its neighbors cities and have been captured hence it is also captured therefore the cities captured at the end of day are day city has c and since city has been captured it is also captured now so by the end of day all cities have been captured this cannot be achieved with fewer soldiers and hence the answer is author admin\ntester

all the characters will of equal width while distributing whitespaces to make the document look prettier one must distribute the extra whitespaces between longer words and if there are multiple whitespaces around which the sum of words is equal start from the whitespace near the start of sentence move to next line if words don t fit in the line\nif only single word in the line align it to

width of the line is so we go by calculating width when there is only one space which is the minimum required between them\ni am the one who knocks in this case total width is so we will shift to newline whenever the counting surpases the width limit in this case so we obtain lines in this scenario i am the width one who width knocks width now while distributing white spaces for each line we rank the spaces between the words using a simple algorithm that is the sum of length of words surrounding it so in the first line the first space is ranked sum of words around it is while the next one is ranked sum of words around it is and while distributing we start distributing from rank and move to other ranks and cycle through them untill the whole width of the line is consumed\nif same sum

on a network of servers and has enlisted your help in determining the practicality of an attack chef discovered that if he simultaneously sends password guesses to all servers he can measure the response time to determine how accurately the guesses were some of the servers in the network are honeypot servers that accept password guesses but cannot be accessed chef does not know which servers are honeypots but he knows how many there are each server has a password consisting of between and lowercase alphabetic characters there is also a salt string which is characters long when a password guess comes to a server the password guess is appended with the salt string and then hashed with the sha hashing algorithm most of the details of the sha hashing algorithm are not relevant to this problem other than the fact that it has an output size of bits each of which equally likely to be or the result is compared to the sha hash of the actual password appended with the salt string chef is able to calculate the sum of the squares of the number of matching bits on each non honeypot server after all the honeypot servers don t give any feedback this sum is denoted the score of a guess there is a limit on the number of password guesses chef can make chef would like you to make password guesses and try to attain a high guess score input output\ninput will begin with a line containing three integers t the number of password guesses to perform n the total number of servers and h the number of honeypot servers after reading t n and h repeat the following procedure t times print a password guess consisting of n lowercase alphabetic strings of length between and make sure to print a newline and flush the output buffer after printing the last string then read a line containing a single integer s the score of the guess attention the program should clear the output buffer after printing each guess it can be done using fflush stdout command or by setting the proper type of buffering at the beginning of the execution setlinebuf stdout failure to flush the output buffer will result in time limit exceeded verdict scoring\nyour score will be the highest score across all

receive data from a special judge program instead of from static files pay special attention to the notice on output buffering described in the input output section below an n n field contains many mines each mine occupies some cell of the field each cell could contain at most one mine there are m mines in all at the field you need to neutralize all of the mines so it will be safe to pass through the mines are neutralized with dynamite a single piece of dynamite can be used to neutralize a single cell you have only k pieces of dynamite but don t worry it is guaranteed that k m you may perform two operations neutralize neutralize the mine in the specified cell if one exists otherwise has no effect this operation may be performed at most k times survey check a cell for a mine and if it doesn t have a mine count the number of cells adjacent to it containing mines previously neutralized mines are not counted each cell is adjacent to up to other cells horizontally vertically and diagonally this operation may be performed at most n times but you could survey the same cell twice if necessary and also it is allowed to survey the cell after neutralize operation was applied to it surveying is very dangerous so you need to try to minimize the number of survey operations you perform submissions that use fewer survey operations will score more points input output\ninput begins with the line containing space separated integers n m and k the size of the field the number of mines and the number of pieces of dynamite respectively the locations of mines are predetermined but currently unknown to you to perform a neutralize operation print a line containing n x y without quotes where x and y are the coordinates of the cell you wish to neutralize x y n to perform a survey operation print s x y without quotes where x and y are the coordinates of the cell you wish to check x y n then read a line containing a single character this character will be m if the cell contains a mine otherwise it will be an integer between and indicating the number of cells adjacent to the specified cell that contain mines when you are finished print done without quotes note that you will receive wrong answer verdict if one of the following happens you will perform more than n survey operations you will perform more than k neutralize operations you will output operation in wrong format in particular x and y should be between and n inclusive you will output done but not all mines are neutralized attention the program should clear the output buffer after printing each line it can be done using fflush stdout command or by setting the proper type of buffering at the beginning of the execution setlinebuf stdout failure to flush the output buffer will result in time limit exceeded verdict for example at c c you could use the following routines char survey int x int y printf s d d n x y fflush stdout char res scanf c res return res void neutralize int x int y printf n d d n x y fflush stdout but it is not necessary here scoring\nsuppose you successfully neutralized all mines using s survey operations then your score is s n lower scores will earn more points sample input output\nin out s in out s in out s in m\nout n out s in out s in out n out n out done explanation\nthe mines are located at and the operations proceed as follows survey this cell does not contain a mine nor do any of its neighbors and so the result is survey this cell does not contain a mine but of its neighbors contain mines so the result is survey this cell contains a mine the survey result is m neutralize destroy the mine in the cell survey this cell was surveyed before however the mine in has now been neutralized so only one mine remains and the result is survey this cell is adjacent to the remaining mine neutralize this cell does not contain a mine but we have a spare piece of dynamite so it s okay to neutralize this cell unnecessarily neutralize destroy the last mine in the cell done all of the mines have now been neutralized note that the above sequence of operations is also consistent with the mines having been located at and this sample performs survey operations and therefore would score test case generation\nn is chosen randomly and uniformly between and inclusive a real number p is chosen randomly and uniformly between and inclusive each cell is independently chosen to contain a mine with probability p then m is set to be the number of mines on the generated field with probability k is chosen to be equal to m otherwise k is chosen randomly and uniformly

into the attic through polly s house and being curious as kids always are they wish to find out what it is that uncle andrew is secretly up to so they start from polly s house and walk along the passageway to digory s unfortunately along the way they suddenly find that some of the floorboards are missing and that taking a step forward would have them plummet to their deaths below dejected but determined they return to polly s house and decide to practice long jumping in the yard before they re attempt the crossing of the passage it takes them exactly one day to master long jumping a certain length also once they have mastered jumping a particular length l they are able to jump any amount less than equal to l as well the next day they return to their mission but somehow find that there is another place further up the passage that requires them to jump even more than they had practiced for so they go back and repeat the process note the following at each point they are able to sense only how much they need to jump at that point and have no idea of the further reaches of the passage till they reach there that is they are able to only see how far ahead is the next floorboard the amount they choose to practice for their jump is exactly the amount they need to get across that particular part of the passage that is if they can currently jump upto a length l and they require to jump a length l l at that point they will practice jumping length l that day they start by being able to jump a length of find how many days it will take them to cross the passageway in the input

rectangle black\nflip all white paint inside the rectangle becomes black and all black paint becomes white chef wants your help in order to paint as few rectangles as possible you will be given the final picture that chef intends to paint you must come up with a plan to paint the picture chef knows this is a difficult problem so he isn t requiring optimal solutions but the fewer rectangles you use the more points you will score input\ninput will begin with an integer n the size of the painting n lines follow with n characters each describing the picture chef wishes to paint the top left corner is the top right corner is n the bottom left corner is n and the bottom right corner is n n a w character indicates the corresponding cell of the painting is white and a b character indicates the cell is black output\nfirst output an integer l the number of rectangles in your solution this number must not exceed n then output l lines each line should consist of pairs of integers followed by a w b or f character the first pair of integers is the row column coordinates of the upper left corner of the rectangle and the second pair is the row column coordinates of the bottom right corner the final character indicates the operation to perform on the rectangle w for white b for black and f for flip constraints n excepting sample input all official inputs are generated by the method

in mandarin chinese and russian this is an interactive problem please refer to interactivity details section in order to get acquainted with the io format good luck about two years ago sergey has bought a wallet since then he s constantly facing kind of difficulty when he pays for something the main reason is that the wallet doesn t have much sections in it but sergey trying to be neat always wants to keep his money in the sorted order for example he doesn t want to put the burles bank note between two burles bank notes so any time he gets the change he finds the appropriate place in the wallet for each bank note that might be very slow and irritating for both the cashier and for the next person in the queue and our protagonist does not like it now it is time to change something of course he could just order a credit card or more spacious wallet but as the person who loves adventures sergey has decided to go another way now in sergey s country there are n types of bank notes the smallest bank note s value is burle the value of the bank note of the i th type is vi burles initially sergey has ai bank notes of the value of vi our protagonist plans all the purchases very well for every his visit to the shop he ll know the amount of money he s going to spend and will report it to you right before the visit to this shop the purchase proceeds in the following way first sergey gives some amount of money to the cashier this amount should not be less than the value of the purchase obviously of course sergey is free to choose the way he ll collect the amount he s going to give for example he can give burles as one bank note of burles or he can use bank notes of the value of burles or he can use bank notes of the value of burles and one bank note of the valie of burles etc it will always be possible to give the amount not less that the required then the cashier gives the change according to the following algorithm first she gives as much bank notes of the largest value as possible in such a way that the given amount doesn t exceed the value of change then she gives as much bank notes of the second largest value as possible in such a way that the given amount considering previously given bank notes of the largest value as well doesn t exceed the amount of the change and so on cashiers are provided with infinite number of bank notes of each type and sergey knows it well in other words cashiers collect the change greedily since there is a bank note of the value of this algorithm will always be enough to collect the change correctly then as the time goes sergey receives some more money it can be a scholarship he s a student or anything else sergey knows the amount of money he s going to get any of these times for getting it there are a few atms in the city the atms are not as good as cashiers so each of them has infinite supply of some set of bank notes but possibly not all the kinds so each time sergey receives some money he chooses the atm where he wants to get it and gets the whole amount from the specified atm nevertheless all the atms has supply of the bank note of the value of so it s possible to receive the required amount of money from any of them it needs to be pointed out that when sergey receives some money he collects it from the chosen atm immediately the atms work the same way as the cashiers when collect a change sometimes new bank notes are issued by sergey s country national bank sergey will provide you the information about such events as well you can consider that after the new bank note is introduced all the shops has infinite supply of this bank note immediately finally some new atms might also be built for each of them the list of present bank notes will be given sergey explored the bank s website and gathered all the information about the new atms now sergey asks you to develop the strategy of how much money he needs to give and using which bank notes and which atms to use in order to minimize the

rank based on ratings over all the months note that we do not consider the initial rating ranking but only the rating and rankings after each of the mm months for a particular player if there are

the months because we consider only the earliest month where he attains the peak ranking the ratings for player after each month are and while his rankings are third second and second respectively his

to various symbols one after another thus telling the answer for this problem consider the alethiometer consisting of symbols digits and letters a z learned scholars were debating the age of the universe and they requested lyra to find out the age from the alethiometer having asked the question the fourth needle started spouting out symbols which lyra quickly recorded in that long string of characters she knows that some substring corresponds to the age of the universe she also knows that the alethiometer could have wrongly pointed out atmost one digit as a letter a z she then wonders what is the maximum possible age of the universe given the set of symbols the alethiometer pointed out help her find the maximum age of the universe which could correspond to a substring of the

slash decorators are very proud of their skills and give an offer to chef the kitchen is a square grid with length nn units and width nn units it is divided into nn rows and nn columns the rows are numbered through nn from top to bottom similarly the columns are numbered through nn from left to right let s denote a cell in the ii th row and jj th column by i j i j the slash decorators want to use nn colourful tiles with dimensions to cover the whole kitchen the tiles can be placed in two orientations as shown in the figure below note that each of these two orientations can be converted to the other by rotating it clockwise the slash decorators initially filled all the cells of the kitchen with tiles where each tile is placed in one of the two possible orientations chef does not know this initial configuration and his task is to find it by asking up to qq queries in each query chef chooses a cell in the grid the slash decorators rotate the tile in the cell clockwise then the slash decorators find all squares with area formed by the blue diagonal lines shown in the figure below and tell chef the number of these squares in addition the slash decorators initially tell chef the number of squares with area formed by the blue diagonal lines in the initial configuration let s denote this number by kk for example in the configuration shown below there are squares with area the queries are not independent i e a tile rotated in a query stays rotated in subsequent queries chef may choose the same tile in multiple queries in such a case this tile is rotated multiple times the offer is that if chef guesses the initial configuration correctly the work will be done for free please help him you play as chef and the grader plays as the slash decorators you should find the configuration the kitchen is in the orientations of all tiles when you finish asking queries note that this is equivalent to finding the initial configuration interaction first you should read a line containing a single integer tt the number of test cases the description of interaction for tt test cases follows for each test case you should start by reading a line containing three space separated integers nn qq and kk then you may ask queries for each query print a line containing three space separated integers xx and yy the grader rotates the tile in the cell x y x y then read a line containing a single integer zz if you ask an invalid query or more than qq queries z z otherwise zz denotes the number of squares with area formed by the blue diagonal lines once you know the current

be f b note that in the definition of f b we are assuming that a is a constant also when b is the empty sequence it is considered to be a subsequence of a and f b would then be now given a we will construct a graph g which has n nodes and labeled directed edges the nodes are v v vn if there are two subsequences of a c and c such that c is obtained by appending the integer b at the end of c and f c f c then the edge vf c b vf c is added to the graph g if it is not already present in the graph note that even if an edge with a different label is already present this edge is added just that there will not be multiple edges from one vertex to another with the same label the edge vi b vj means that it is a directed edge from vi to vj and it has the label b chef constructed this graph but then lost the sequence a as well as all the labels on the graph so all he has left is a directed graph with possibly multiple edges from one vertex to another and now he wants to find the sequence a since there could be many such sequences which fit the graph he wants to find the lexicographically smallest such sequence help chef in finding this input the first line contains a single integer t which is the number of testcases the description of each testcase follows the first line of each testcase contains two integers n and m this means that the input graph has vertices v v vn and m

appending to the empty string hence there should be an edge from v to v with the label similarly f and f hence there should be an edge from v to v with label by looking at all such possible pairs of

current player is lara then she receives a i points if the current player is jonah then he receives b i points each value of i can be chosen only once either by lara or jonah not both the game always ends after n moves the player with the maximum number of points wins task\ngiven the values of n a and b can you determine the outcome of the game print first if lara will win print second if jonah will win print tie if they will tie assume both players always play optimally input format the first line of input contains a single integer testcases denoting the number of test cases each of the subsequent lines describes a test case a single test case is defined over the following three lines an integer n denoting the number of elements in arrays a and b n space separated integers a a a an

each test case print one of the following predicted outcomes of the game on a new line print first if lara will win print second if jonah will win print tie if they will tie input output first\ntie\nsecond\nexplanation testcase a b lara and jonah make the following n moves lara chooses i and receives points jonah chooses i and receives points note that jonah will not choose i because this would cause lara to win lara chooses i which is the only remaining move and receives points as all n moves have been made the game ends lara s score is points and jonah s score is points so lara is the winner and we print first on a new line testcase a b because both players will only make move and all possible point values are the players will end the game with equal scores thus we print tie on a new line testcase a b because both players will only make move and all the possible point values for jonah are greater than all the possible point values for lara jonah will win the game thus we

rather strange they may or may not be exactly rectangular but the walls of the room are aligned either vertically or horizontally to the town s xy axis additionally each wall is integral in length thus the rooms are denoted by using the letters and let us denote a place occupied by one letter as cell here specifies one unit of horizontal wall specifies one unit of vertical wall and means the wall turns in the center of the cell for example one of the valid rooms is the following also if you draw a horizontal segment whose the end points are in the room then the whole of the segment is inside of the room and there are other constraints for the rooms please see notes some samples of valid rooms for input and some samples of invalid rooms for input how weird but it gives a chance to lot of children to play a game together the game starts with all children standing on corners of the room more precisely children stand on the nearest empty cell which is inside of the room each child stands in one corner and all corners must be occupied we only consider corners which make a degree angle inside the room those that make degree angle inside room are not considered as a corner in the below figure are valid corners but is not thus all the cells denoted by will have one child note that it is possible that the two corner has space for only one child as shown below in the game a child can swap positions with a child standing at an adjacent corner thus in the below figure child a can swap place with either b or d and child d can swap place with either a or e inside a room many swaps can be taking place simultaneously but each swap is between children only also while swapping positions children should keep one hand touching the wall which means they can move only along the walls a b c d ef considering each child takes one second to walk to an adjacent empty cell some pair of friends want to know the minimum time in which they can cross each other crossing happens when children both moving towards the corner of the other child for swapping meet briefly in the middle of swap and a child can start to swap with other child only when both children stand at corners for example when child c swaps with f the swapping will be the following and they cross with time input\nfirst line consists of an integer n then n lines follow to represent the room children are described as capital alphabets a z to specify the child standing next to a corner there may be several children labelled with same alphabet in row major order the first child with some alphabet is referred to as the second as and the rd as and so on after n lines there is a line which contains t the number of queries then t lines follow each containing a pair of space separated labels character and number to denote the pair of friends output\nfor each of t given pair of friends you have to output the minimum time in which the given pair of friends can cross each other assuming that the pair of friends play intelligently and each pair starts from the original positions output t real numbers places after decimal one on each line constraints n length of each of n lines to describe a room t example\ninput a b c a e a e\nc a output notes all the labels given in input are valid that is each label denotes one child in the room all children are inside of the room children labelled by the same letter do not appear on the same horizontal line the room must satisfy the condition if you draw a horizontal segment whose the end points are in the room then the whole of the segment is inside of the room all empty cells which are inside the room are connected where an empty cell means a cell denoted by a space or a capital alphabet a z for each of wall cells and there is at least one empty cell which is inside of the room lying next horizontally vertically or diagonally to each other for each of corner cells there is a cell having a child in the next diagonally to the corner cell for each of cells having children there is a corner cell in the next diagonally to the cell having a child there is at least one line of n lines to describe a room whose first character is not a space the last character of each of n lines to describe a room does not be a space some samples of valid rooms for input a b b a ab the room described in the above figure is valid a b c d in the above figure child b can swap place with child d directly a b c d e the room described in the above figure is also valid some samples of invalid rooms for input a b d ef in the above figure there are corners

depending upon points upgrade policy of their choosing at the time of registration each customer is also given a jackpot target special facilities will be provided to the customer if the accumulated points of the customer become equal to this jackpot however accumulating points more or less than the jackpot does not earn them anything for example for a customer with jackpot target special facilities will be provided if and only if his her points becomes exactly equal to after some purchases of course the simplest plan that may be adopted by the customer is to increment his points by after each purchase however an intelligent customer would like to achieve the jackpot score in the minimum number of purchases even still for a single customer the number of weeks in which he gets the jackpot will be equal to the number of purchases since only the first purchase in a week qualifies towards upgrade of points the most intelligent customer of all would partner with a friend and try to merge their points in the end of course this is better because this means that fewer weeks will be necessary to achieve the jackpot alice and bob are going to use this strategy they will decide a sub target score for themselves which may be different for each of them and try to reach that sub target in the fewest number of weeks at the rate of one purchase per week once both of them reach that sub target they will merge their points to achieve alice s jackpot target see the explanation section for clarification write a program that takes as input alice s jackpot score and outputs the minimum

the first example alice and bob have already reached the target in the second example they both choose the sub target and achieve it in week by making one purchase each their merged score then becomes equal to in the last example alice chooses to reach and bob chooses to reach alice can reach in weeks and bob reaches in week thus they achieve their target in weeks bottlenecked on alice there are more ways to split the target to still achieve it in weeks but there is no way to split the target among them to achieve it in weeks hence the answer is in the last test case alice and bob can split the target as and can be achieved alice in purchases or weeks can be achieved by bob in purchases or weeks hence the answer is of course there are other ways but there is no way that can achieve this

formal terms zenfix expression is an expression which consists of tokens each token is either an operation from the list or an integer all arithmetic operation here are bit operations they are defined through auxiliary unary operation bit residue as follows please read this carefully some definitions are non standard bit residue of a is defined as the unique integer x in the range for which the usual difference of a and x is divisible by bit difference a b is defined as a bit residue of the usual difference of a and b bit sum a b is defined as a bit residue of the usual sum of a and b bit product a b is defined as a bit residue of the usual product of a and b bit quotient a b is defined as the smallest integer c in the range such that b c a note the b c here is a bit product of b and c if no such integer c exists then result of division is undefined which means that error occurs during the calculation bit power a b is defined as follows for b we define a b a a a where a repeats b times here is a bit multiplication for b we define a finally for b we define a b a b where a b is defined above b is the usual negation of b and is a bit division operation if result of division here is undefined it means that error occurs during the calculation bit factorial a is defined as follows for a we define a a here is a bit multiplication for a we define finally for a we define a a here again is a bit multiplication and x for x means usual negation each operation has its own priority defined by its index in this list the smaller the index the higher the priority therefore the most priority operation is factorial the second most priority operation is exponentiation the third most priority operation is division the fourth most priority operation is multiplication the fifth most priority operation is addition and finally the less priority operation is subtraction we could abbreviate the list of operations sorted by priority as fedmas the first letter of the title of each operation was chosen the evaluation of a zenfix expression goes as follows if expression contains a factorial sign followed by an integer then we choose the leftmost such occurrence and perform the factorial operation which will be defined below namely we replace the integer that follows the factorial sign by its factorial value and delete the factorial sign from the expression otherwise if there exists an operation followed by at least integers we at first choose the first operation in edmas with this property that is among operations followed by at least three integers we choose the operation with the highest priority then we choose the leftmost occurrence of such a case with this operation and perform calculation namely we replace the operation and two following integers by the result of this operation applied to these integers if error occurs during this calculation then you should stop evaluation of expression otherwise if there exists an operation followed by exactly integers we proceed exactly as in the previous rule we repeat the first three steps until we can no longer repeat them or error occurs during some calculation at the end of this evaluation if we are left with a single integer the expression is called correct otherwise it is called incorrect in particular if error occurs during some calculation the expression is incorrect your task is for the given zenfix expression check whether it is correct or not by modeling process of its evaluation and output each intermediate calculation that occurs input\nthe first line of the input contains an

the process of evaluation of the expression namely at each step when successful calculation is performed output on a separate line i o a b c here i is the index of the operation in the list of tokens of the current expression tokens are number starting from o is the operation itself one of the characters in the set a and b are the operands in case of a factorial operation output b as c is the result of operation o applied to numbers a and b or only to a in case of a factorial operation after all possible calculations are performed output ok if the expression is correct and not ok otherwise example\ninput output ok ok not ok not ok explanation\nexample case the expression is considering evaluation rules we see that only the third rule with operation is applicable so we calculate which is

output ok example case the expression is the underlined operation will be performed first as it is the only operation followed by at least three integers so we replace with by the same reason as above we replace with by the same reason as above we replace with among candidates and the is performed as it has higher priority so we replace with the underlined operation is the only one followed by at least integers so we replace with by the same reason as above we replace with now we are left with only one operation followed by two integers so we replace with we are left with a single integer therefore expression is correct and we output ok example case the expression is among all the operations followed by at least integers has the highest priority as there are more than one such

with now among all the operations followed by at least integers has the highest priority so we replace with now there is only one operation that can be performed so we replace with now no evaluation rule can be applied and we stop the evaluation since we are left with more than one token the expression is incorrect and we output not ok example case the evaluation proceeds as follows not ok here

the chef a task and said that the chef could leave only after solving it the task of the king required a lot of calculations and the chef thought he would have to stay in the chess kingdom forever hopefully the chef woke up and realized that it was just a dream no actually it was a nightmare the chef could not sleep in the rest of the night worrying that he might meet the king again thus the chef really needs your help to finish the task of the king the task that the king gave to the chef is described as follows the chess kingdom is a n n chess board the rows are numbered by integers from

denoted as cell i j the chess kingdom is guarded by k bishops standing at k different cells of the board additionally there are m other chess pieces standing on m different cells on the board the bishop can move any number of squares maybe zero diagonally but can not leap over other pieces in other words a bishop at the cell a b can move to the cell u v if we can pick the vector x y in the set so that u a t x and v b t y for some positive integer t and all the cells of the form a i x b i y in which i t are empty the cell is called safe if some of the bishops can move to this cell in particular all cells where bishops stand are safe the chef is required to find the number of safe cells input the first line of the input contains three space separated integers n k m each of the

becoming more and more merciless his mind is becoming full of cruel intentions today he has decided to slowly poison and kill some of the staff members of his kitchen yeah he is bored with them there are n chefs in the kitchen besides the chief chef every chef in the kitchen has an index the index of the chief chef is remaining n chefs have indices between and n and no two chefs have the same index as any other kitchen in the street every chef has exactly one immediate superior and can have any number of superiors above him a chef say a is superior of another chef say b if either a is the immediate superior of b or a is the superior of immediate superior of b the chief chef is on the top position and superior to all n chefs and has no superior above him if a is immediate superior of b then b is called immediate inferior of a if a is superior of b then b is called inferior of a see the example for better explanation every chef makes exactly one dish daily there is a small custom in the kitchen that every day each chef should taste the dishes made by all his superiors on that day so if our chief chef swaps the dish made by chef a with a poisonous one every inferior of a will taste this dish on that day and get poisoned every poisonous dish has some specific sickness value x and the health of every chef poisoned by it decreases by x on that day as soon as the health of a chef drops to zero or less he dies when a chef dies in the kitchen chief chef recruits a new chef to replace the dead chef so the immediate superior and all the immediate inferiors of the dead chef will become the immediate superior and immediate inferiors of the new chef respectively the newly recruited chefs are very healthy in fact you can assume that they have infinite health chef has made some poison recipes and has some queries for you he asks you one query per day for q continuous days he has two types of queries he gives you two integers a and x which means that he wants to make the dish made by a poisonous on that day with a poison of sickness value x he gives you one integer a in this type of query he wants to know how many chefs among the inferiors of a are old chefs i e not newly recruited chefs remember that chef can also poison the dish made by himself which will be tasted by all n chefs input\nthe first line contains an integer n the next n lines have two integers each the first integer on the i th line is the health and the second integer is the index of the immediate superior of chef with index i the index of immediate superior of the chef is strictly less than the index of the chef the next line contains an integer q the next q lines contain one query each each query starts with an integer which represents the type of query if it is then it is of the first type and is followed by two space separated integers a and x in this order if it is it is of the second type and is followed by one integer a the meanings of variables are well explained in the statement output\nfor each query of the second type print one integer as asked in the question constraints n q a n h x example\nsample input sample output example explanation\nin this sample chef and chef have chief chef chef as immediate superior and chef and chef have chef as immediate superior immediate inferiors of the chefs are chef chef and chef chef nonechef chef and chef chef nonechef noneinferior chefs of the respective chefs are chef chef chef chef chef chef nonechef chef chef chef nonechef none\ninitially the healths of these chefs are on the first day chief chef poisons the dish of chef which will be tasted by his inferiors chef chef with a poison of sickness value so after that the healths of these chefs become as the th chef s health dropped to zero he dies on this day he will be replaced by a new chef with inf infinite health healths of chefs after day inf on the second day chief chef asked you the second type query to give the number of old chefs among the inferiors of chef as one inferior of chef died on first day only one inferior chef of chef is old chef and output is healths of chefs after day inf on the third day chief chef poisons the dish of chef i e his dish with poison sickness and it is tasted by everyone and poisons all the other chefs so after that the healths of these chefs become inf as the st and the rd chefs health dropped to zero they die on this day and are replaced by two new chefs with inf infinite health the health of chefs after day is inf inf inf on the fourth day chief chef asked you the second type query to give the

events of type i n example\ninput output na explanation\nat the beginning all stores are empty so the answer for the first query which asks about the store is na the first plan of the chef is which means the items with price are added to the stores correspondingly so in the next query asking about store the answer is we have only one item to buy with no conservation fee the second plan of the chef is so the items with price are added to the stores correspondingly now the store now contains two items with the corresponding prices are and the answer for the query about store is still we still don t have any conservation fee the store contain only one item with price is so the answer for the query about this store is the first conservation fee policy is which cause a conservation fee of for each of stores the stores contains items one costs unit of money and the other costs we need to pay unit of money for the conservation fee so the largest amount of money we can spend for one item in store is the second conservation fee policy is so a conservation fees of are added to the stores and correspondingly hence the largest amount of money we can spend for one item in store is

roads in the path from one to other if the plane drops a bomb on a city a with damage value x then the damage done to a city b will be floor x d where d is the distance between a and b note that as the distance of a from itself is the damage done to a will be floor x x each city has a certain wealth wi in it if it is damaged by a value of x then its wealth is reduced by x on a day if the wealth of a city becomes less than or equal to zero then it is considered economically dead your task is to write a program that keeps track of the bombings done by the plane and answer the queries asked by the chef the chef has a total of q queries for you there are two types of queries chef gives you two integers a and x which means that the plane drops a bomb on the city with index a with damage value x a bomb can also be dropped on economically dead city chef gives you an integer a and you need to print the number of cities that are economically dead which have a in the path from the capital to

nn rows numbered through nn and nn columns numbered through nn there are nn elephants and they stand at the perimeter of the pond in such a way that there is exactly one elephant at the top and bottom of each column and at the left and right end of each row since elephants can only see straight in order to drink an elephant must stretch its trunk over and into the pond if an elephant s trunk has length ll it covers ll nearest cells to the elephant in the elephant s row or column for example for an elephant with trunk length standing at the south side of column its trunk should cover cells n n n n and n n since elephant herds have a strict hierarchy the elephants on each side of the pond order themselves in such a way that their trunk lengths are either non increasing or non decreasing it is guaranteed that the trunks of elephants at the opposite ends of a row or column will never touch each other but it is still possible for the trunks of some elephants which are on adjacent sides to touch or intersect in this scenario the trunks of two elephants touch if there is at least one cell they both cover the elephants do not want this to happen so some of them have to leave your task is

string contains only lowercase english letters along with the character a substring of ss is a contiguous subsequence of that string for example the string chef is a substring of the string codechef but the string codeh is not a substring of codechef a substring of ss is good if it is possible to choose a lowercase english letter cc such that the following process succeeds create a string rr which is a copy of the substring but with each replaced by the letter cc note that all occurrences of must be replaced by the same letter for each lowercase english letter compute the number of times it occurs in ss and the number of times it occurs in rr let s denote them by aa and bb respectively the characters in the original string ss are ignored when computing aa check the parity of aa and bb if they do not have the same parity i e one of them is even while the other is odd then this process fails if the parities of the number of occurrences in ss and rr are the same for each letter the

of them are good a is not good as a occurs an odd number of times in this substring and there are no to replace is also not good as replacing by any letter causes this letter to occur in rr an odd number of times aa is a good substring because each letter occurs in it an even number of times and there are no to replace a is also a good substring we can replace with a then rr is aa and each letter occurs in this string an even number of times note that replacing e g with b would not work rr would be ab where both a and b occur an odd number of times but we may choose the replacement letter cc appropriately aa is not a good substring for any replacement letter cc we find that cc occurs an odd number of times in rr example case we especially note that a is not a good substring

of pairs of different characters in the same position may be a good indicator however it will not work well in the case when two strings have different lengths the longest common subsequence will also fail when strings are too long recently professor of math l p c has invented the special method to deal with this problem his invention has been known as a simple but creative solution the difference is based on the number of substrings a non empty group of consecutive characters of one string that are not substrings of the other string let s learn about his invention call the first string as a and the second string as b let s be the set of all different substrings of a and t be the set of all different substrings of b we then define another set p which consists of all the strings that belongs to s or t but not both according to the professor l p c method the size of p is a good indicator to measure the difference between a and b for example let a aacd and b cdaa we can see that s a aa aac aacd ac acd c cd d t c cd cda cdaa d da daa a aa p aac aacd ac acd cda cdaa da daa size of p is and we can say the level of difference between a and b is your task is to find this indicator

solve the hardest computer science problems on strings in this problem we ll consider a simplified version of suffix trees suffix tries that is tries formed by all suffixes of a given string generally the suffix tree is a tree whose edges are labeled with strings instead we ll only consider suffix tries whose edges are labeled with single characters this way every edge of a suffix tree may correspond to one or more edges connected in a chain style fashion of a suffix trie another trait of suffix trees is that each suffix of the string for which the suffix tree is built corresponds to exactly one path from the tree s root to a leaf this is usually achieved by terminating each suffix of the string with a special character say however in suffix tries we won t do that in particular this implies that the number of leaves in a suffix trie can be smaller than the length of the original string in the picture the suffix tries for strings aba and abac are presented if we erase all letters from the edges of a suffix trie it actually becomes a directed graph let s call two suffix tries equivalent if their corresponding directed graphs are isomorphic you re given a single string consisting of lowercase latin letters your task is to find the number of different strings of the same length consisting of lowercase latin letters as well such that their suffix tries are equivalent to the suffix trie of the given string as this number can be large enough output the remainder of its division by input\nthe first line contains a single number t the number of test cases no more than

substance which is believed to have the power to transmute precious metals stones and even lives of living beings chef wishes to use the stone to restore his son jim s body to its original form following a terrifying accident in their lab it is known that philosopher s stones break apart into an odd number of shards when they re used up after searching far and wide chef has collected n shards of what he believes to be a previously used philosopher s stone where n is an odd integer he believes that fusing these shards back together will yield a real stone in its entirety leveraging his encyclopaedic knowledge of alchemy chef recalls an ancient book with the following ritual for fusing shards arrange the n shards in a row numbered from to n note the colour ci of each shard i which is either auburn or black denoted by the characters a and b respectively choose a consecutive sequence of three shards remove them from the row and fuse them together into one new shard the three shards must not all be the same colour or such an intense concentration of similar energies will cause a dangerous rebound explosion instead there must be two differently coloured shards that will neutralise each other get converted into energy via the law of equivalent exchange and become infused with the third shard in other words assuming no explosion the resulting shard s colour will be equal to the most common colour present amongst the three chosen shards place the resulting shard back into the original gap in the row with the remaining shards in the same relative order before and after it repeat steps and until only one shard remains note that each time steps and are performed the number of remaining shards decreases by therefore given that the initial number of shards is odd enough successful repetitions will result in exactly one final shard the philosopher s stone help chef determine whether or not it s possible to get to that point and hopefully save his son jim without causing any rebound explosions along the way input format input begins with an integer t the number of philosopher s stones that chef tries to reconstitute for each stone there are two lines

some contiguous part of a number in one operation if all the digits are the same we define an operation as deleting some contiguous part of a number which has the same consecutive digits chef has had many breakups till now so actually speaking he needs to forget many numbers as such he can concatenate his first girlfriend s number with his second girlfriend s number and can delete it as whole but he should make sure that he doesn t concatenate his first girlfriend s number with his third girlfriend s number which turns out to be an injustice to his second girlfriend in simple words he can concatenate numbers in the order of his breakups and then delete them as a whole number or carry on with deleting the numbers individually chef wants to know the minimum number of operations it will

explanation\nthe initial arrangement of reagents in test tubes is after reversing the contents of the st and rd test tube the arrangement becomes after the first operations the arrangement becomes after the first operations after the first operations after all operations the reagents get separated the cost paid for the th operation is and the cost paid for the th operation is the cost paid for all other operations is thus the reagents are separated with a total cost note that this is not necessarily an optimal way to separate the reagents in the actual test data nn is and mm is smaller values have been used in this example for clarity test generation\nthe generator used to generate the test cases can be found here n n m m initially for each ii i n i n the ii th test tube is completely filled with mm ml of the reagent with colour ii a parameter g g is chosen and the following operation is performed gg times two different test tubes ee and ff such that ee is not empty are chosen randomly and ml of reagent is transferred from top of ee to ff we consider the capacities of the tubes to be infinite here then for each test tube that contains more than mm ml of reagents the volume of reagents in it is decreased to mm by transferring excess reagents in whole mililiters from the top into tubes that contain less than mm ml of reagents randomly then the test tubes n n and n n are made empty by transferring their contents randomly to other test tubes that contain less than mm ml of reagents the values of c c cn c c cn are chosen uniformly randomly and independently between and inclusive then another parameter k k is chosen finally n n kn n k distinct unordered pairs of distinct colours are chosen randomly for each of these pairs u v u v u v n u v n du v dv udu v dv u is chosen uniformly randomly and independently between and inclusive for all other such pairs du v dv u du v dv u there are test files corresponding to all possible combinations of parameters gg and kk scoring\nthe checker used to determine the score of your submission can be found here if you perform an invalid operation or the reagents are not separated after all the operations particularly if there is a test tube which contains reagents with more than one colour or there is a colour which appears in more than one test tube then you will receive the wrong answer verdict otherwise the score for a test file is the total cost of all the operations the score of a submission is the sum of scores of all test files your goal is to minimise this score there are test files during the contest the displayed score will account for exactly test files i e your score reflects your submission s performance on of the test files however if your program gets a non ac verdict on any test file your submission s verdict will be non ac in other words an ac verdict denotes that your program runs successfully on all the test files after the end of the contest your score will be changed to include the sum of your program s scores over the other test files author jay editorial https discuss codechef com problems wtrsort\ntags april greedy heuristic implementation jay tie breaker

war strategy they would just attack the enemy randomly and overpower them with sheer number of soldiers however we all know that baahubali and bhallaladeva defeated the kalakeyas by following the thrishul strategy and successfully defended their kingdom maahishmati we also know that baahubali was very smart and the truth is that he predicted how the kalakeyas would attack and devised a counter strategy for the same the night before the war this is what he found the kalakeyas had n forts numbered to n and baahubali had n soldiers numbered to n baahubali discovered that he can permute his soldiers in any way to get a permutation of to n p p pn he would then send his soldiers to attack the forts in the following way soldier p attacks fort soldier p attacks fort soldier pn attacks fort n it is easy to note that each soldier attacks exactly one fort and no two soldiers attack the same fort baahubali also got to know about a secret key of the kalakeyas which is an integer k a soldier x can destroy a fort y iff abs x y k for more details on the abs function check here your task is to determine whether baahubali s soldiers can be permuted in some way such that all forts can be

the bottom element of this row to the top ss times for example applying an operation on the matrix results in the matrix because it means that left cyclic shift should be applied two times on the

chef forms a pile with cards from top to bottom chefu s pile is then the game proceeds like this in the first round chef draws the card with value and wins a card with value from chefu so his pile is and chefu s pile is after this round note that the value of the card transferred from chefu to chef decreased to in the second round chef draws a card with value and chefu draws his card with value so chefu wins the round the value of the card that is transferred from chef to chefu decreases to so this card is removed from the game after this round chef s pile is and chefu s pile is in the third round chef again draws the card with value and wins chefu s last card after this round chef s pile is and chefu s pile is empty therefore chefu loses the game author utkarsh\neditorial https discuss

perform every century as a sign of respect and worship towards bool the god of byteland all the monks train for many years in order to accomplish an extremely hard task that is the one of accessing the sacred temple of byteland where only the best of the bests monks are allowed to enter and worship their god bool the training the monks perform usually consists of several physically and intellectually challenging tasks trained and perfected over the course of many years so that one of them can be eligible for the ultimate task that is a combination of both physical effort as well as mental effort this final task is the actual possibility of trying to access the sacred temple of byteland that is located on the top of a very high mountain where reckless storms and heavy rains usually occur the access to this mountain is done by climbing an enourmous set of stairs that spiral around the mountain until it ends on the top of the mountain where the sacred temple door is located the door can only be opened by unlocking it to unlock the door the monk only sees a hole in it a lever and he also spots a very large amount of little round stones on the ground and he understands that the only way to open the door is to place an exact pre determined amount of stones trough that hole so that when the number is correct he will push the lever down and the door will open if this number is incorrect the lever will be locked by the incorrect stones and a whole new century must pass so that the storms can erode the stones and a new monk can be selected for the task this year you were the one selected to climb the huge set of stairs and you are extremely well prepared you have done your training very well and you are also aware of two very important facts that will be key for your success the favourite number base on byteland is base and gods favourite number is the largest number on this base you also know that the number of stones you need to place on the door hole is related to the way everyone climbs the stairs and with the number of stairs itself as the monks take several supplies for the demanding trip they can only climb either one or two steps at a time you understood that the number of stones you need to place on the door is closely related with the way you climb the stairs suppose the number of stairs you need to climb is n also let the number of ways you have of climbing those n stairs be m now the number of stones required is equal to the number of s in the base representation of m modulo you won t fail as you are extremely well ready but you have made everyone on your town extremely excited with your journey so given the number n of steps you are to climb and a guess g from the people of your village you need to see if they are correct or not more formally given a number n of steps to climb and a guess g from your village you need to check if guess g is accordingly to your correct calculations they are correct if you manage to enter the temple using their guess or incorrect otherwise you should output the string correct if they are correct or incorrect if they are incorrect quotes for clarity only please read the section output explanation for some clarification on the example cases input\nthe first line of each official test case file will contain an integer t that stands for the number of test cases on that specific test case file the next t lines contain two space separated integers n and g respectively the number of steps the monk needs to climb and the guess from the village s population output\noutput will contain the string correct or incorrect on a single line as explained above on the problem statement constraints\nin each file t i e each file will contain test cases this value needs to be read from standard input n g your code will be judged against several input files example\ninput and more test cases output correct\nincorrect and more answers output explanation on the first case when there is only one step to climb there is only one way to do it in binary is and as the village s population guess is also the answer is correct on the second case there are ways of

continues his tournament taking the j th position on the next round while the weakest of two is forced to leave the only knight who has won k rounds is the winner the only knight who has won k rounds

of lazer we create line segments between pairs of points i ai and i ai for each valid i the height of a line segment connecting points x y and x y is defined as y y you are given q queries in each

this beam collides with zero or more of the line segments described above the beam is considered to collide with a line segment if it intersects or touches this segment except when the left endpoint

bico grid has been released the rules of bico grid are very simple the game field is a x matrix where each cell is either a blocked cell or a cell with some number of coins for a regular player the

record c n i denotes binomial coefficient n choose i the player starts from the cell situated at row r and column c in the matrix the objective is to collect exactly g number of coins from matrix in several moves there are some rules on each move the player must collect all the coins from some unblocked cell in the current column the rules of the game state that player mustn t be really greedy so the number of coins he collected must not increase in other words if at some move the player collected x coins then further he cannot collect more than x coins in a single move after each move the player is immediately moved to some cell of the column w where w denotes the current column of the player if the current column of the player has index the game ends the game ends when player collects

main road runs from to n the second from to n and the third from to n the ith secondary road i n runs from i to i additionally there are arterial roads that run diagonally from some x y to x y or from some x y to x y x and y are integers all roads are bidirectional we also define a block as the square area bounded by corners x y x y x y x y for integers x and y maniland is n blocks long and blocks wide the following figure shows a sample layout of maniland note that arterial roads on the same block also intersect n x the police station is located at the intersection now the police have a daily routine of inspecting all roads and to inspect any part of road they must pass through it however they find out that whenever they perform the inspection they always end up traversing some road or part of some road more than once a particular layout is called inspection friendly if one can start from the police station traverse all parts of all roads exactly once except possibly intersections and end back at the police station the layout above is not inspection friendly but the following one is x x note that each road is traversed exactly once some intersections are traversed twice but that s okay now the government wants to make maniland inspection friendly because the police hate traversing a road twice and sometimes end up skipping roads specifically the government plans to destroy some arterial roads and build new ones however the main roads and secondary roads will be left unchanged the cost of building and destroying an arterial road that goes from x y to x y is hb and hd respectively and the cost of building and destroying an arterial road that goes from x y to x y is lb and ld respectively the government wants to know the minimum total cost it needs to make maniland inspection friendly and the number of ways to achieve this minimum total cost the arterial roads must obey the maniland public works and highways law all arterial roads must run diagonally from some x y to x y or from some x y to x y they cannot be built outside the grid and\nno two arterial roads can connect the same pair of intersections note that the order in which the roads are built destroyed doesn t matter two ways are considered different only if the resulting layout is different in the first figure above assuming hb hd lb ld then the minimum total cost is and there are ways to do it as shown in the following figure x x the government hired chef rams to calculate these two values for them they didn t want to hire real programmers because they re very temperamental

site denethor s decryption of dequeue permutations though the stewards deemed that it was a secret kept only by themselves long ago i guessed that here in the white tower one at least of the seven seeing stones was preserved in the days of his wisdom denethor did not presume to use it nor to challenge sauron knowing the limits of his own strength but his wisdom failed and i fear that as the peril of his realm grew he looked in the stone and was deceived far too often i guess since boromir departed he was too great to be subdued to the will of the dark power he saw nonetheless only those things which that power permitted him to see gandalf sauron and saruman have been communicating from large distances using the seeing stones denethor with great difficulty has been able to break into their channel of communication using his strength of will despite this however it seems that their communication has been encrypted gondor s spies in isengard have found out the encryption algorithm they use and have reported back to denethor the algorithm is as follows we refer to a dequeue as a double ended queue we define a dequeue permutation of n as a permutation of to n that can be got by starting from a dequeue having elements n in that order with at the front and n at the back and performing any sequence of n pop front or pop back operations note that not all permutations of to n are dequeue permutations for example with n you have etc as dequeue permutations whereas aren t you can t have right at the beginning since its not at any end of the dequeue if sauron wants to encrypt the number k and send it to saruman he would instead send the k th lexicographically smallest based indexed dequeue permutation of n that is if sauron wanted to send to saruman he would just send n since this is clearly the smallest lexicographic dequeue permutation of n sauron is transmitting the size of his army to saruman so that they can coordinate an attack on the men of rohan and gondor since sauron s will is so powerful denethor is able to get only vague glimpses of the numbers and he is able to remember only the first half floor n elements of the permutation further since these images are so vague his understanding of the numbers happens out of order for example denethor may understand that the th number of the permutation is and later on only understand that the rd number was help him estimate the minimum and maximum possible size of sauron s army value of k given the number n and incremental understanding of the first half of the permutation not necessarily in order note since the values to be output can be rather large output the values modulo note it may be the case that denethor s understanding of the permutation is flawed if it is not possible to have a dequeue
